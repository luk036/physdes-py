Interval Class

This code defines an Interval class, which represents a range of numbers with a lower bound
and an upper bound. The purpose of this class is to provide a way to work with intervals
of numbers, allowing various operations and comparisons to be performed on them.

The Interval class takes two inputs when creating an instance: a lower bound (lb) and an
upper bound (ub). These can be either integers or floating-point numbers. The class then
stores these values and provides methods to access and manipulate them.

The main outputs of this class are the results of various operations on intervals, such as
checking if two intervals overlap, finding the intersection between intervals, or
calculating the minimum distance between intervals.

The class achieves its purpose by implementing a variety of methods that perform
calculations and comparisons on the lower and upper bounds of the intervals. For example,
the overlaps method checks if two intervals have any numbers in common, while the contains
method determines if a given number or interval is entirely within another interval.

Some important logic flows in this code include:

1. Comparison operations: The class implements methods like __lt__, __gt__, __le__, and
   __ge__ to compare intervals with other intervals or single numbers.
2. Arithmetic operations: Methods like __add__, __sub__, and __mul__ allow intervals to be
   added, subtracted, or multiplied by scalar values.
3. Set-like operations: The hull_with method finds the smallest interval that contains both
   the current interval and another interval or number, while intersect_with finds the
   overlap between two intervals.

The code also includes utility functions outside the class, such as hull and enlarge, which
can work with both Interval objects and scalar values. These functions provide a more
flexible way to perform operations on intervals and numbers.

Overall, this Interval class provides a comprehensive set of tools for working with ranges
of numbers, which can be useful in various applications such as scheduling, resource
allocation, or numerical analysis. It allows programmers to easily manipulate and compare
intervals without having to manually handle the lower and upper bounds separately.

ManhattanArc Class

This code defines a class called ManhattanArc, which represents a geometric object in a 2D space.
The purpose of this class is to handle operations on points, segments, or regions that are
rotated 45 degrees. It's designed to work with different types of coordinates, such as
integers, floats, or intervals.

The ManhattanArc class takes two inputs when creating an object: xcoord and ycoord. These
represent the coordinates of the object in the rotated space. The class doesn't produce a
specific output on its own, but it provides various methods to manipulate and interact
with these objects.

The class achieves its purpose by storing the coordinates in a Point object and providing
methods to perform operations like translation, enlargement, intersection, and merging
with other ManhattanArc instances. It uses a 45-degree rotated coordinate system, which allows
for easier calculations in certain geometric operations.

Some important logic flows in this code include:

1. The constructor (init) creates a Point object with the given coordinates.
2. The construct method creates a ManhattanArc from regular x and y coordinates by rotating
   them 45 degrees.
3. The translation methods (iadd and isub) move the object by adding or subtracting
   vector components.
4. The min_dist_with method calculates the minimum rectilinear distance between two
   ManhattanArc instances.
5. The enlarge_with method creates a new ManhattanArc with enlarged coordinates.
6. The intersect_with method finds the intersection point between two ManhattanArc instances.
7. The merge_with method combines two ManhattanArc instances by enlarging them based on their
   distance and finding their intersection.

These operations allow for complex geometric manipulations, which can be useful in various
applications such as computer graphics, game development, or computational geometry. The
class provides a high-level interface for working with these rotated geometric objects,
abstracting away some of the more complex mathematical calculations.

"""
Global Router for VLSI Physical Design.

This module provides a global router that offers multiple strategies for routing between a
source and multiple terminals. The global router is a key component in the VLSI physical
design flow, responsible for finding paths for interconnects while considering various
constraints such as wirelength and timing.

The `GlobalRouter` class implements several routing algorithms, each tailored for different
optimization goals:
- `route_simple()`: A basic approach that connects terminals directly to the nearest
  point in the routing tree.
- `route_with_steiners()`: A more advanced technique that inserts Steiner points to
  minimize wirelength.
- `route_with_constraints()`: A performance-driven strategy that considers both wirelength
  and timing constraints.

This modular design allows users to choose the most appropriate routing strategy for their
specific needs, providing a flexible and powerful tool for global routing tasks.

Vector2 Class

This code defines a Vector2 class, which represents a two-dimensional vector in mathematics
or physics. A vector is an object that has both magnitude and direction, typically
represented by x and y coordinates in a 2D space.

The purpose of this code is to provide a reusable structure for working with 2D vectors,
along with various operations that can be performed on them. This class can be used in
applications like game development, physics simulations, or any scenario where 2D vector
calculations are needed.

The Vector2 class takes two inputs when creating a new instance: x and y coordinates.
These can be integers, floats, or even other Vector2 objects, allowing for flexible use
in different contexts.

The class produces Vector2 objects as outputs, which can be printed, compared, or used in
further calculations. It also provides methods for common vector operations like addition,
subtraction, multiplication by a scalar, and division by a scalar.

To achieve its purpose, the Vector2 class uses Python\'s object-oriented programming
features. It defines several methods that overload standard operators (like +, -, *, and
/), allowing vector objects to be manipulated intuitively. For example, you can add two
vectors simply by using the + operator between them.

The class includes important logic flows for vector operations. Addition and subtraction
are performed component-wise, meaning the x and y values are added or subtracted
separately. Multiplication and division by a scalar apply the operation to both x and y
components. There\'s also a cross product method, which calculates a special type of
multiplication between two vectors.

The Vector2 class also implements comparison operations, allowing vectors to be checked
for equality. It provides a string representation of the vector for easy printing and
debugging.

An interesting feature of this class is its use of generic types, allowing it to work with
different numeric types (like integers or floats) or even nested Vector2 objects. This
makes the class very flexible and usable in a wide range of scenarios.

Overall, this Vector2 class provides a comprehensive toolkit for working with 2D vectors,
encapsulating the mathematical concepts and operations into an easy-to-use Python class.
It\'s designed to be intuitive for beginners while also offering advanced features for more
complex use cases.
